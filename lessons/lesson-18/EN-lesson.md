     Cypress provides basic reporting in the CLI, including details on passed, failed, and skipped tests.
   - **Custom Reporters:**  
     Plugins like `cypress-mochawesome-reporter` can generate more detailed HTML reports.
     ```bash
     npm install cypress-mochawesome-reporter --save-dev
     ```
     Then configure in your Cypress configuration:
     ```javascript
     module.exports = defineConfig({
      reporter: 'cypress-mochawesome-reporter',
      reporterOptions: {
        charts: true,
        embeddedScreenshots: true,
        inlineAssets: true,
      },
       e2e: {
          setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
            require('cypress-mochawesome-reporter/plugin')(on);
          }
       }
     });
     ```
     Add to cypress/support/e2e.js
     ```
     import 'cypress-mochawesome-reporter/register'
     ```

2. **Customizing Report Outputs:**
   - Customize report title, theme, and output paths using reporter options.
   - Analyze metrics such as test duration, retry counts, and error logs for insights.

3. **Analyzing Test Results and Metrics:**
   - Review screenshots and video recordings provided by the Dashboard.
   - Use the detailed logs and snapshots to pinpoint failures and performance bottlenecks.
